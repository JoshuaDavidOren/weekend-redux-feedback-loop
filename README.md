## Description

This is a fullstack application to submit feedback, there is also an admin feature to view all submissions. I had no problems with base mode, a little annoyed at all the copy pasting between almost identical screens. 
I wish I had more time to work with material UI. I did struggle finding a good way to show your current selection while also showing the previous selection if you went back a page. Over All it was a fun project! 


Fork and clone the repo.
npm install
npm install redux react-redux
npm install redux-logger
npm install react-router-dom
npm install moment
npm install sweetalert2
npm run server
npm run client

you will need to create a database with the provided data.sql file

After you run client, localhost:3000 should pop-up in your browser.

go threw the questions and submit you answers, If you would like to see your data just go to localhost:3000/#/admin to flag and delete your data.
